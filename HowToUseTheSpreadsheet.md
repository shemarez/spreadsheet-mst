# Simple Uses #

To start a new spreadsheet, go to "File" -> "New". It will reset the spreadsheet to the initial state which is an empty spreadsheet.

To change a cell's formula, **double click** to the cell. The cell's formula will come up and you can make changes to it. You **must** press enter to commit your changes. The spreadsheet will now update the cell's value and re-calculate other cells if needed.

A warning will pop-up and the cell's formula will revert to previous state if you've done one of the following:
  * Access an out of bound cell
  * Circula reference in a cell's formula
  * Division by 0

_Note about save and load_:
You **must** save your spreadsheet with the extension "**.mst**" in order for the open to work.

This spreadsheet has fixed table size in term of rows and columns. Don't try to insert more rows or columns. **You're not allowed to!** However, you can re-size (zoom in and out) the spreadsheet in any way your want :D.
